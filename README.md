## Simple Task Lister

A little program I worked on to help me get famliar with PyQT5

## Instructions

* Make sure you have Python installed
* Download run ```python tasklister.py``` from the CMD window within the folder

You can add/delete tasks and it will save it to a text file so you can open/close the program.
